      Quiltro is a tool that allows you to collect tweets using a keyword or set of keywords. You can use Quiltro to keep a record of tweets about a certain subject or event or to build a dataset of tweets to use for analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started you must create a Twitter developer account which you can do <%= link_to "here", "https://dev.twitter.com/user/login" %>. Then register for a Quiltro account, enter your Twitter dev account details and you're ready to go! Once registered with an account you can create multiple searches, each of which will collect and save tweets for you directly from the twitter APIs.
